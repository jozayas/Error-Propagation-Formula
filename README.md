# Error Propagation Formula Calculator

An online calculator for error propagation formulas, designed to simplify the process of converting and calculating error propagation for scientific expressions.

## üöÄ Features

- Convert human-readable formulas to LaTeX format.
- Calculate the error propagation formula and copy it in LaTeX format.

## üìã Usage

Access the calculator [here](https://jozayas.github.io/Error-Propagation-Formula/).

1. Enter the scientific expression you want to propagate.
2. Click on the "To LaTeX" button.
3. Copy the calculated error propagation formula as needed.

## üìù About

This project aims to simplify the process of handling error propagation formulas, especially for scientific literature where these expressions can become lengthy and complex.
While this calculator provides a quick solution, for more robust data analysis, we recommend using the [Python Uncertainty Package](https://pypi.org/project/uncertainties/), which is compatible with NumPy and offers more advanced features.
